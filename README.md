## Description + Goal


As a passionate language learner, I frequently find myself searching for new characters on purpleculture.net. This process used to involve several steps:

1) Select text
2) Copy text
3) Open new tab
4) Type purple culture url
5) Replace old character query with new one
6) Enter / Search

To streamline this process, I created the Purple Culture Extension. Now, searching for new words is as simple as:

1) Select text
2) Right click
3) Search Purple Chinese

This extension aims to make searching for Chinese characters quicker and more convenient.

## Learnings
Prior to the creation of this extension, I had no idea what a context menu even was. Within an hour, i've learned not only what the right click menu thing was called, 
but also how to make my ideas come to life allowing me to expand my skills in browser extension development.
